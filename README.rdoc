=MetaTags

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) plugin for Ruby on Rails applications.

==Titles

Page Titles are very important for Search engines. The titles in the
browser are displayed in the title bar. The search engines would look at
the this title bar to determine what the page is all about.

Recommended title tag length: <b>63 characters</b>

==Description

Description tags are called meta tags as they are not displayed by the
browsers as that of titles. But these descriptions may be displayed by
some search engines. They are used to describe the contents of a page in
2 or 3 sentences.

Recommended description tag length: <b>156 characters</b>

==Keywords

Meta Keywords tag are used to place your keywords that you think a
surfer would search in Search engines. Repeating keywords unnecessarily
would be considered spam and you may get permanently banned from SERP's

Recommended keywords tag length: <b>256 characters</b>

==MetaTags Usage

First, add this code to your main layout:

	<head>
		<%= display_meta_tags :site => 'My website' %>
	</head>

Then, to set the page title, add this to each of your views (see below for other options):

	<h1><%= title 'My page title' %></h1>

When views are rendered, the page title will be included in the right spots:

	<head>
		<title>My website | My page title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>My page title</h1>
	</body>

===Using MetaTags in controller

You can define following instance variables:

	@page_title = 'Member Login'
	@page_description = 'Member login page.'
	@page_keywords = 'Site, Login, Members'
	
Also you could use +set_meta_tags+ method to define all meta tags simultaneously:
	
	set_meta_tags :title => 'Member Login',
				  :description => 'Member login page.',
				  :keywords => 'Site, Login, Members'

===Using MetaTags in view

To set meta tags you can use following methods:

	<% title 'Member Login %>
	<% description 'Member login page.' %>
	<% keywords 'Member login page.' %>

Also there is +set_meta_tags+ method exists:

	<% set_meta_tags :title => 'Member Login',
					 :description => 'Member login page.',
					 :keywords => 'Site, Login, Members' %>

The +title+ methods returns title itself, so you can use it to show the title
somewhere on the page:

	<h1><%= title 'Member Login' %></h1>

If you want to set the title and display another text, use this:

	<h1><%= title 'Member Login', 'Here you can login to the site:' %></h1>

===Additional options for +display_meta_tags+

Use these options to customize the title format:

	* +:prefix+ - text between site name and separator
	* +:separator+ - text used to separate website name from page title
	* +:suffix+ - text between separator and page title
	* +:lowercase+ - when true, the page name will be lowercase
	* +:reverse+ - when true, the page and site names will be reversed

And here are a few examples to give you ideas.

	<%= title :separator => "&mdash;" %>
	<%= title :prefix => false, :separator => ":" %>
	<%= title :lowercase => true %>
	<%= title :reverse => true, :prefix => false %>
